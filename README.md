This secure messaging application is designed to facilitate encrypted client-to-client 
communication over a global server architecture. Unlike conventional messaging platforms 
that may store and process user data in plaintext, this application ensures that messages are 
encrypted end-to-end, safeguarding them from unauthorized access.
